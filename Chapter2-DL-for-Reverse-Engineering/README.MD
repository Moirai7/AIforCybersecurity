# Deep Learning based Reverse Engineering 

This folder contains some basic code and data to demonstrate reverse engineering through deep learning. Since reverse engineering contains a bunch of tasks. However, most of these tasks can be solved through the similar procedure. Therefore, we select function boundary identificaion task to demonstrate the deep-learning based program solving schemes. Other reverse engineering can be easily solved through a similar method. Besides, this folder include original source code if the author released their source code.


## FunBoundary 

We generate the data and implement the model based on a pretrained model [palmtree](https://github.com/palmtreemodel/PalmTree).

## FunSignature

The code is forked from [EKLAVYA](https://github.com/shensq04/EKLAVYA)
